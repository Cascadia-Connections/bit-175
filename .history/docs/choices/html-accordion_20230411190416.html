            An accordion is a kind of expanding text, used to show (and hide)
            HTML content. It often displays as a list of items stacked on top of
            one another. When clicked on (or triggered by a keyboard interaction
            or screen reader), these headers will either reveal or hide
            associated content.

        <div class="jspanel">
          <p>
            There are all kinds of uses. It's often used for an FAQ (frequently
            asked questions), a troubleshooting guide, or a glossary.

            It's often used to save space, to let people scan just the
            categories or questions, find the one they want, and then expand it
            to see the answer. They don't have to scroll through a bunch of
            content that's not pertinent to what they're trying to do.
